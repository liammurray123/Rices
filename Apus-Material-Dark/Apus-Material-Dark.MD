### Install files from Github

The KDE Plasma theming is saved in the Apus-Material-Dark.knsv file in this repo, you use Konsave to install it. It is in a tar.gz archive on Github, so that I could upload it more easily.

The Latte Dock settings are saved in the `Apus-Dock.layout.latte` file.

### Set theme using Konsave

Once you have downloaded Apus-Material-Dark.knsv, you can install it with [Konsave.](https://github.com/Prayag2/konsave)

Move into the folder you have the .knsv file in and run one of the commands below.

```bash
konsave -i <path to the file>
```

konsave --import-profile <path to the file>
```
