# KDE Plasma Rices

Saves of my rices on Manjaro KDE Plasma, using [Konsave](https://github.com/Prayag2/konsave).

## How to use
In each folder, there is a Readme with info on the widgets and how to import using Konsave. If any are not in a konsave export, I will give specific instructions.

**For Konsave:**
`konsave -i <path to the file>` or `konsave --import-profile <path to the file>`

## Social Media & Using
If any of these are half decent, I will probably post them to [r/unixporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/).
Feel free to use them, and edit them! Share what you do with them, I want to see your creativity!
